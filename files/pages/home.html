      What I said this afternoon might sound like I don't miss you a lot... But
      to be honest with you, when I woke up every morning, I think of you. I
      miss you. I want to see you. I want to go to Spesial Sambal with you. I
      want to make you the best goddamn pizza you will ever eat in your entire
      goddamn life. I want to treat you to all the Soju we can find in the
      store.
    </p>

      I miss you too, goddamnit.
